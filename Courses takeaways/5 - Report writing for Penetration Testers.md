Screenshots have a specific goal, which is to convey information that would take several sentences to describe or to make an impact.

To recap, a good screenshot has the following characteristics:
- is legible
- contains some visual indication that it applies to the client
- contains the material that is being described
- supports the description of the material
- properly frames the material being described
