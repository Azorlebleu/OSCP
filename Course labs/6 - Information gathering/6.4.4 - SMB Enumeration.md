1. Server message block (SMB) is an extremely important service that can be used to determine a wealth of information about a server, including its users. Start up _Topic Exercise VM Group 1_ and use Nmap to identify the lab machines listening on the SMB port and then use _enum4linux_ to enumerate those machines. In doing so, you will find a machine with the local user _alfred_. The flag is located in the comments on one of the SMB shares of the host that has the _alfred_ user.
2. 
```bash
# Enumerating hosts listening on the default SMB ports
nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.163.1-254 > output.txt
grep "445" output.txt | cut -d" " -f6

# Listing shares for every IP
for ip in $(cat hosts.txt); do enum4linux $ip;done;
```
