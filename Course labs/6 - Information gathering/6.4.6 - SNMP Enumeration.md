1. Scan your target network on VM Group 1 with onesixtyone to identify any SNMP servers. Once done, list all the running process on the only Windows host that is running an SNMP server. What is the full name of the SNMP server process?

```bash

# Listing SNMP servers via OneSixtyOne
onesixtyone -c communities -i ips

# Other way via nmap
nmap -p 161 -sU 192.168.163.1-254 -oG nmap-snmp.txt
grep open/ nmap-snmp.txt

# Found IP 192.168.163.151. 

# Listing the processes 
snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.163.151 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2
```



1. On the same Windows host, run one of the SNMP query we have already explored in this section. This time appending the `-Oa` parameter to the command. This parameter will automatically translate any hexadecimal string into ASCII that was otherwise not decoded. What is the first Interface name listed in the output?

```bash

# Reading everything from the MIB
snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t 10 192.168.163.151 -Oa | grep -i interface
```
