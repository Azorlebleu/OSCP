1. **Capstone Labs**: Follow the steps above to perform the vulnerability scan with the custom NSE script on VM #1. Copy the link from the script output after _Verify arbitrary file read:_ and use it as a parameter for curl. This will retrieve the content of **/etc/passwd** of the target machine and display it. Be aware that you need to use _http_ instead of _https_ while keeping port 443 when you paste the link. Embed the last username of the file in the braces of "OS{}" and provide it as the answer to this exercise.

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "http-vuln-cve2021-41773" 192.168.221.13
```
